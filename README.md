## About Me

As a seasoned and highly skilled senior smart contract engineer, I bring a deep passion and expertise in the crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), and web3 space to every project. My specialty is in solidity smart contract development for a wide range of use cases, and I excel in collaborative environments with like-minded, driven individuals.

With a thorough understanding of DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), decentralized applications (dApps), web3, crypto, and blockchain in general, I have been building web3 projects since 2018. I am deeply committed to leveraging this cutting-edge technology to make a meaningful impact in the world.

Also, I speak English with a native-level fluency, with a proven ability to communicate effectively and collaborate remotely, making me a valuable asset to any team. With my combination of technical skills, industry knowledge and ability to work well in a remote setting, I am confident that I can bring significant value to any organization looking to leverage blockchain technology.
